# Changelog

## macchina v6.0, codename "Gallium"

We hope you'll enjoy this release as much as we did preparing it :heart:

If you want to give back to macchina, tell your friends about it :)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `MACCHINA_CONF` has been deprecated. The reason being that it accomplishes
  the same thing as `--config`. (#200)
- In themes, the `hide_bar_delimiters` option has been deprecated. We've
  renamed it to `hide_delimiters` and moved it to the [bar] section. (#200)
- In themes, the `palette` option has been deprecated. There's now an entire
  section dedicated to the palette component named [palette]. (#200)

### Bugfixes

- The command-line flag named `--short-uptime` has been renamed to
  `--long-uptime`, the option in your configuration remains the same. (#200)
- libmacchina: The desktop environment readout now prefers
  `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, with `DESKTOP_SESSION` as a fallback. (#199)
- A spacing bug that results in uneven space between the left and right side of
  the separator in certain situations has been fixed. (#200)
- A spacing bug that results in more space being used than specified when the
  separator is invisible has been fixed. (#200)
- Every option in theme files is now entirely optional, you will no longer get
  into trouble with cryptic error messages when forgetting to set some options.
  (#200)
- macchina should hopefully be able to locate macOS users' themes now. (#200)

### Features

- We've added back the option to display your physical or logical core count.
  (#200)
- There's two new manpages! One for configuration and another for
  customization. (#200)
- macchina now searches through more locations for its themes, like
  `/usr/share`. (#200)
- There's now a much nicer error reporting for themes. (#208)

You can now:
- use indexed and hexadecimal colors for any option that accepts a color.
  (#193)
- tell macchina what pool of colors to use in the randomization process. (#200)
- specify the kind of border you want the box to use. (#200)
- specify the glyph used by the palette (#200).

### Other nice things

- `--list-themes` gets a new look, and it tells which theme is active now as
  well.
- Some under-the-hood changes and refactoring work that very slightly improve
  performance and make the codebase nicer to navigate.
- macchina and libmacchina's dependencies have been bumped, so we're mostly
  up-to-date.
- libmacchina: Gentoo users no longer need `portage-utils` for the package
  readout to report their package count.
