MACCHINA(1)

# NAME

macchina - A system information frontend, with an (unhealthy) emphasis
on performance.

# SYNOPSIS

*macchina* [FLAGS]

# FLAGS

*-d, --doctor*
	Checks the system for failures.

*-e, --export-config*
	Prints a template configuration file to stdout.

*-c, --config*=_FILE_
	Specify a custom path to a configuration file.
	
	This is helpful in cases where macchina fails to parse the configuration
	file from the default path, i.e. *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/macchina.toml*.

*-l, --list-themes*
	Lists all available themes.

	Themes are *TOML* files which must be placed in
	*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/themes*.  Whatever this flag
	returns to the console can be used with the *--theme* flag.

*-t, --theme*=_THEME_
	Specify the name of the theme to use, i.e. its basename and
	without the ".toml" extension.

	You should verify whether macchina was able to find your theme
	with *--list-themes*.

*-i, --interface*=_IF_NAME_
	Specify the network interface for the LocalIP readout, e.g. "wlan0", "eth0".

*-s, --current-shell*
	Toggles between the current shell, i.e. the parent of the terminal emulator, or the default one.

*-C, --logical-cores*
	Toggles between logical and physical cores for the Processor readout.

*-K, --long-kernel*
	Lengthens kernel output.

*-S, --long-shell*
	Lengthens shell output.

*-U, --long-uptime*
	Lengthens uptime output.

*-h, --help*
	Prints help information.

*-v, --version*
	Prints version information.

*-o, --show*
	Display only the specified readouts.

	Please note that the order these are listed in will be the order that they are
	displayed in.
