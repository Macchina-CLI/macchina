# About Macchina <a name="about"></a>
_Macchina_ lets you view basic system information, like your hostname, kernel, uptime, memory usage, and much more.
It provides you with convenient features and extensive customization options but doesn't lose sight of its two main priorities, minimalism and performance.

Are you ricing your desktop and would like a program to display your system information, or you want it to load as soon as you open your terminal?

_Macchina_ has you covered.

If you're interested in the library _Macchina_ uses to fetch your system information, check out [libmacchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina), any issues relating to _fetching_ should be filed on that repository.

## Meet Doctor
_Macchina_ comes with a very special flag, allowing you to know why certain elements, for example, your operating system information might not be appearing. It can differentiate between errors, and warnings, and its comprehensive output should help you understand where the issue is coming from.

To use this feature, run `macchina --doctor`

_Macchina_, like many other open-source projects, would not be where it is right now without the help of its contributors, thank you all so much!

- Support for __NetBSD__ would not be possible without the help and testing of NetBSD/pkgsrc package maintainer [pin](https://pkgsrc.se/bbmaint.php?maint=pin@NetBSD.org)
- Support for __macOS__ and __Windows__ would not be possible without the help, testing and major contributions of [123marvin123](https://github.com/123marvin123)
- Support for __OpenWrt__ was made possible through the contributions of [uttarayan21](https://github.com/uttarayan21)
