# Upgrading to v2.0

The second major version of macchina includes a breaking change in _macchina's_
configuration file that could result in an error if you don't update your
configuration accordingly.

### `<2.0`

macchina.toml:

```toml
palette = "<True|False>"
```

### `>=2.0`

macchina.toml:

```toml
# this is optional, leaving it out/commenting it hides the palette
palette = "<Dark|Light|Full>"
```

### Thanks to

- [FantasyTeddy](https://github.com/FantasyTeddy) for the new customization option; _macchina_ can now show your
  dark, light or all the color variants that your colorscheme is set to
  display.

# About

_macchina_ lets you view system information, like your kernel version, uptime,
memory usage, processor load and much more.

If you're interested in the library _macchina_ uses to
fetch system information, have a look at
[libmacchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina);
fetching-related issues should be filed on that repository.

# Performance

_macchina_ is lightning fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using

# Features

## Themes

_macchina_ comes equipped with built-in themes that style their readouts, bars
and separators differently. No extra configuration required.

## Bars

Bars provide a way to visualize data, and each theme styles them differently.
They can be enabled using the `--bar` flag.

## Doctor

_libmacchina_ can sometimes fail to fetch certain readouts, and _macchina_ has
a feature in place that allows you to analyze why they failed, this is done
through the `--doctor` flag.

# Configuration

See
[macchina.toml](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/macchina.toml)
for an example configuration file.

- In order for _macchina_ to be able to read the configuration file, you need
  to place `macchina.toml` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/`

You can also create custom themes in `JSON` format, themes allow for more
customization and are separate from the main configuration file.  See
[Carbon.json](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/theme/Carbon.json)
for an example theme.

- In order for _macchina_ to be able to read your custom themes, you need to
  place them in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/macchina/themes/`. You can have as many as you
  want, just avoid using the names of built-in themes.

To start using your theme: 
1. Run `macchina --list-themes` to verify that macchina has listed your theme
2. Inside `macchina.toml`, add `theme = <name_of_theme_without_json_extension>`
3. You're good to go! _macchina_ will start using your theme.

_macchina_, like many other open-source projects, would not be where it is
right now without the help of its contributors, thank you all so much!

- Support for **NetBSD** would not have been possible without the help and
  testing of NetBSD/pkgsrc package maintainer
  [pin](https://pkgsrc.se/bbmaint.php?maint=pin@NetBSD.org)
- Support for **macOS** and **Windows** would not have been possible without
  the help, testing and major contributions of
  [123marvin123](https://github.com/123marvin123)
- Support for **OpenWrt** and **Android** was made possible through the many
  contributions of [uttarayan21](https://github.com/uttarayan21)
