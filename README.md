# üí¨ About <a name="about"></a>

_macchina_ lets you view system information, like your kernel version, uptime,
memory usage, processor load and much more.

If you're interested in the library _macchina_ uses to fetch system information,
have a look at [libmacchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina);
fetching-related issues should be filed on that repository.

# ‚ú® What's new in `v5.0` <a name="upgrading"></a>

## Deprecation of two command-line flags

`--no-ascii` and `--custom-ascii` have been deprecated and have moved to our
theme mechanism.

**Why?**

- They do not define the behavior of macchina, rather the look of it. So we
  moved them to their new home.

**Where can I see an updated list of the current command-line flags?**

In our wiki,
[follow this link](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/wiki/Usage).

## Themes

As previously mentioned, themes have gotten two new additions. Also, the `color`
option has been renamed to `key_color` to avoid ambiguity. Have a look at at the
provided
[example theme](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/theme/Carbon.toml).

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance <a name="performance"></a>

_macchina_ is lightning fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using
  [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)

## üêß Linux

# üöÄ Features <a name="features"></a>

## Themes

_macchina_ comes equipped with built-in themes that style their readouts, bars
and separators differently. You can see the list with the `--list-themes` flag
and use the one you like with `--theme <name>`. Did you know that you can
[make your own](#customization)?

Themes live outside the configuration file, so you can create a bunch of them,
and switch between them at any time.

## Bars

Bars provide a way to visualize data, through symbols rather than numbers, and
they can be enabled using the `--bar` flag.

## Doctor

_libmacchina_ can sometimes fail to fetch certain readouts, and _macchina_ has a
feature in place that allows you to see why they failed, this is done through
the `--doctor` flag.

# üîß Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

The configuration file define the behavior of macchina, it does not allow for
much customization. See
[macchina.toml](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/macchina.toml)
for an example configuration file.

In order for _macchina_ to be able to read the configuration file, you need to
place `macchina.toml` in:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina` on Linux and the BSDs.
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/macchina` on macOS.
- `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/macchina` on Windows.

# üé® Customization <a name="customization"></a>

Themes define the look, layout and styling of _macchina_. See
[Carbon.toml](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/theme/Carbon.toml)
for an example theme.

In order for _macchina_ to be able to find your themes, you need to place them
in:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/themes` on Linux and the BSDs.
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/macchina/themes` on macOS.
- `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/macchina/themes` on Windows.

> Note: Avoid using the names of built-in themes.

To start using your theme:

1. Run `macchina --list-themes` to verify that macchina has listed your theme.
2. Add that same name you see in your terminal to the `theme` option in
   `macchina.toml`
3. You're good to go! _macchina_ will start using your theme.

cd macchina
makepkg -si
```

### Nix

- Where `<channel>` is `nixpkgs` or `nixos`:

```bash

```

The
[installation wiki page](https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina/wiki/Installation)
lists some other ways you can install the program or the steps to compile from
source.

You might prefer running the
[prebuilt binary](https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina/releases) that corresponds
with your operating system.

# Contributors

[![Crates.io](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=grtcdr/macchina)](https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina/graphs/contributors)

_macchina_, like many other open-source projects, would not be where it is right
now without the help of its contributors, thank you all so much!

- Support for **NetBSD** would not have been possible without the help and
  testing of NetBSD/pkgsrc package maintainer
  [pin](https://pkgsrc.se/bbmaint.php?maint=pin@NetBSD.org)
- Support for **macOS** and **Windows** would not have been possible without the
  help, testing and major contributions of
  [123marvin123](https://github.com/123marvin123)
- Support for **OpenWrt** and **Android** was made possible through the many
  contributions of [uttarayan21](https://github.com/uttarayan21)

# ASCII Art

Some of the ASCII art displayed in macchina is **not** our own.

If you (the artist) are not okay with us using your ASCII art, please
