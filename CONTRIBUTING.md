Thanks for taking interest in our project, we'd love to work with you.

# You might ask yourself:

## Where do I submit my PR?

[Right here!](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/pull/new/main)

## Okay, will my PR get merged?

It depends, our highest priority is to maintain great performance throughout
feature releases. If your PR includes a kind of feature which **inherently**
hinders performance considerably, it will unfortunately be rejected.

Other than that, all contributions are welcome.

## Alright, are there any coding conventions?

I personally don't really think about that â€” We have a bot that will
automatically format everything the best it can when you submit a PR; the end
result is _muy bueno_ readability and a consistent code style across
the whole project.

## Got it! Where should I start?

_libmacchina_, definitely. We're lacking a lot in the unit testing department.
Also, even though we've minimized our dependency list, we could use a hand
writing our own implementation of things.
